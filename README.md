# musicgen
Creating a LSTM music generator using Keras.
Used tutorial from https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-generate-music-using-a-lstm-neural-network-in-keras-68786834d4c5

First, run music_gen_lstm.py to train the neural net. You can replace the midi files with your own training set.
Next, load the last produced weights file into the predict.py file and run predict.py to generate music.
